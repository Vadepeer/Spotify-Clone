# Spotify Music App Clone

This project is a clone of the Spotify music app, created using HTML and CSS. The aim of this project is to replicate the basic UI/UX design of the popular music streaming service, providing a clean and responsive layout for users to explore. This project serves as a great way to practice and showcase front-end web development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The Spotify Music App Clone mimics the core interface of the Spotify app, including elements such as the sidebar, main content area, and player controls. While it does not include backend functionality or real music streaming capabilities, it focuses on the visual aspects to deliver a realistic representation of the Spotify interface.
